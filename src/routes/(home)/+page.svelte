                    Geesecraft is a Minecraft SMP hosted by <a href = "https://iipython.dev">iiPython</a> yearly as part of summer break.
                    It started with 2 members (DmmD and iiPython) in May of 2021, and has since grew to 5 members and is still running as
                    of June 2024.

                    What are the rules of Geesecraft? Simple, there are none. Geesecraft is a you-do-you type server where members aren't
                    required to do anything they don't want to. If you want to bomb somebodies house, go for it (although expect to be bombed back).

                <p>
                    This is an automation-centered server, and no matter what season you join, you will see automatic farms, game-breaking
                    contraptions, and whatever else you could imagine. Since Season 4, we've also incorporated tech mods such as Applied Energistics
                    2 into the server, giving us even more power over the landscape.
